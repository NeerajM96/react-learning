Q)Why is react a library and not a framework?
Ans) For frameworks we need to generate the entire project into that framework but for react which is a library it doesn't need to be
generated for the entire project as react can exist in only a small portion of our app(by injecting react cdn) eg. we can have react only 
in header, we can have react only in footer.

-->React.createElement() returns a javascript object and when this object is passed inside root.render() it gets converted to html and
gets render inside root div.

-->If some html is already present inside root div used for react then when root.render() executes it will replace the content
inside root with content passed inside root.render().

Q)Why passing passwordGenerator as a dependency in useEffect(from 03passwordGenerator react project)?
Ans)By including passwordGenerator as a dependency, you're ensuring that the useEffect always uses the latest version of the function, reflecting any changes in its dependencies. This is especially important if passwordGenerator relies on props or state values that may change over time.
